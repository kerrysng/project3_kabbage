### APPROACH

We decided on a microblogging travel app as the group had a clearer view of the outcome and function for the app.

We first created wireframes and relational tables/databases.

#### Wireframes

### FUNCTIONALITY
Tripr - Your new photo share experience. <br>
<br>
Users are able to view other users cards or SEARCH for either a country or city.  Once logged in - users are able to pin other users cards to their Moodboard. Moodboard is an inspirational/idea board for the user's future travel. <br>
<br>
Users are able to create trips, in which they specify the start and end date of each trip. In each of the trip, the user creates cards to upload pictures and their blogs. The current location of where the photo is uploaded gets pinned on the map. <br>
<br>
Users are able their own profile. Update email address / first name / last name / password. <br>
<br>
Dashboard / Trip / Moodboard View - Users are able to click and expand each of the pictures to provide details. <br>
<br>
Users are able to edit and update their own cards(blogs).
